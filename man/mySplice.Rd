\usage{
mySplice(
  maf_file,
  bam_list,
  bed_file,
  output_file,
  min_reads = 5,
  return_granges = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{maf_file}{Path to the input MAF file}

\item{bam_list}{Path to the TSV file listing sample ID and BAM paths}

\item{bed_file}{BED file with exon/intron junction annotations}

\item{output_file}{Path to output result file}

\item{min_reads}{Minimum number of supporting reads to report a novel junction (default 5)}

\item{return_granges}{Logical; if TRUE, return result as a GRanges object with supporting reads in list-columns}
}
\value{
If return_granges is TRUE, a GRanges object is returned; otherwise nothing is returned
